Disease Ecology meeting w/Erin

Paper
- questions
- criticisms
- methods, results, their interpretation
- what could be done from there?
- apply this to your research how?

Topics
Review about disease ecology (generally)
Landscape ecology and disease (heterogeneity; fragmentation/metapopulations)
Biodiversity: species richness and susceptibility (dilution vs amplification)
Abiotic (field?)/anthropogenic factors
Biodiversity: community structure/interactions (predation, competition) and disease - modeling papers (network analyses)?
Biodiversity: genetic diversity (MHC; immune response; other genes??)
Phylogenetics/invasion history/naive hosts?
Microbiome and disease (chytrid, white nose sydrome, fungal snake??)
Biodiversity: diversity of parasites (lower prevalence and number of parasites per individual)
Genomics and experimental infection - genetic component to susceptibility 

Biodiversity and disease (virulence, prevalence...)
	- species richness and susceptibility (dilution vs amplification)
	- genetic diversity (MHC; immune response; other genes??)
	- diversity of parasites (lower prevalence and number of parasites per individual)
	- community structure/interactions (predation, competition) and disease - modeling papers (network analyses)?
